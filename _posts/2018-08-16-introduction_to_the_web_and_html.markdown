This week i began exploring the background of the web and delving into HTML. HTML seemed so simple and straight forward. Or so I thought.

Everything was going smothly and the format made sense. My parents there whole life worked for newspapers, either as a reporter or newspaper editors. So the <header>, <body>, and the other formatting elements made sense to me naturally. It laid out exactly like how a newspaper and newspaper article would! I was excited to find another real world example to connect me with my coding exploration!

I soon realized that that was the tip of the HTML iceberg. I soon started exploring the [MDN HTML Elements Reference Page](http:/developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/) and was both amazed and concerned at the same time. There were so many different elements to learn! How would I have time to go through each one and know what they did?

Luckily for me there were many tutorials. I decided to play around a create fake websites for friends and companies. I used [MDN HTML Elements Reference Page](http:/developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/) as a reference if I wanted to add something to the site instead of gonig down each element as a list. I added the most frequent elements I used and what they did in a seperate notepad. Im still at the tip of the iceberg, but I continue to gain more and more knowledge.
