On July 1st, I began my journey into the coding world. Since then I gone through many emotions. Joy. Frustration. Satisfaction. Anger. Happiness. Each lab starts as a challenge but end with a sense of pride and accomplishment. As my first month with The Flatiron School is coming to a cloase, I wanted to look back and track the decisions and opportunity that brought me here.

My first forray into coding was way back in highschool. During my junior year, I took a C++ course. I remember the course being very fun and interesting, but being distracted by other highschool interests (girls, fitting in, etc.). Nonetheless, the seed was planted.

The next time the coding seed grew a little more was my freshman year at Towson University. I took a logic class and it quickly became my favorite class I took at college. Thinking back on it, the logic problems reminded me of my C++ class and the coding I am learning now at Flatiron. At some point I had to decide on a major, and I chose pschology, another interest of mine. I wanted to understand all people in all walks of life and use that understanding to help however I could. After graduating, I became a social worker.

Being a social worker is great! I have helped people in many ways and have watched them grow and acheive amazing things. That feeling and satisfaction is great and one of the best things in the world. However, not alot of people do not think of the other side of the social working coin. Unfortunatly, things do not always go as planned and there are let downs and failures. As much as I loved social work and, more importantly, the people I have met, it was time for a change.

As luck (or fate) would have it, my dad heard an ad for Flatiron School and thought it would be a great idea to look into it. At this time, I was reading various technology and gaming magazines, blogs, videos, etc., I remembered my C++ class and my logic class from the past. I remembered the joy I would get completing a logic puzzle. Then I began working on the practice labs and looking up coding blogs and tutorials online. Next I attened free classes in Washington, DC. It was time to finally pull the plug. On July, 1st, I began my coding journey.

Now, a look to the future. What will I do once I complete all my courses? Honestly, I am not sure. The future is scary and bright. I know I want to using my new knowledge with coding to help my community. How will I do that? I am not sure, but I will be sure to let you know!
