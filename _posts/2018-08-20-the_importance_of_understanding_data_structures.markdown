Coming into learning coding, I knew that I would be spending the most time learnign data structures. I have always been better at English than Math. Same with my family. Both my parents are great writers and reporters. However, the building blocks of programming and development are algorithms. These need to be understood, on a fundamental level, to begin mastering and getting the code to act the way it is supposed too. So i am starting with the basics: Arrays, Linked Lists and Objects.

Luckily, Data Structures are just that: A way to structure information to have it easily accessible. "The basic idea of a data structure is to store data in a way that meets the needs of your particular application." Little to no math at all! There is hope for me afterall! Per [Wikipedia](http://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure#Examples):

* An array is a number of elements in a specific order, typically all of the same type (depending on the language, individual elements may either all be forced to be the same type, or may be of almost any type). Elements are accessed using an integer index to specify which element is required. Typical implementations allocate contiguous memory words for the elements of arrays (but this is not always a necessity). Arrays may be fixed-length or resizable.

* A linked list (also just called list) is a linear collection of data elements of any type, called nodes, where each node has itself a value, and points to the next node in the linked list. The principal advantage of a linked list over an array, is that values can always be efficiently inserted and removed without relocating the rest of the list. Certain other operations, such as random access to a certain element, are however slower on lists than on arrays.

* An object is a data structure that contains data fields, like a record, as well as various methods which operate on the contents of the record. In the context of object-oriented programming, records are known as plain old data structures to distinguish them from objects.

Arrays was the first data structure I learned and the easiest (to me at least). I consider it the bead and butter, the basic data structure. Arrays are stored with a position attached. Link lists "can be used to implement several other common abstract data types, including lists, stacks, queues, associative arrays, and S-expressions."

Finally, we come to Objects. Objects are very important, as Ruby is an OBject Oriented Language. Object refers to a particular instance of a class, where the object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures. Objects have  identity, properties, and attributes.

This is just the tip of the iceberg. As I contiune learning, I will revert back to old posts and update the the more I learn! Stay tuned!
