I did it! Its done! After alot of trial and error I have completed my CLI Scraper Project. For the project I decided to make a CLI that first displayed the top 50 breweries in the United States according to Untappd. Untapped is a place where users, after making a profile, rate beers, check in to breweries, and post there experience of the brewey they visted. I am very proud of the CLI I have written, eventhough it took longer than expected. Settign up and designin this CLI all on my own was very daunting.

The first thing to conquer was settign up the enviorment. Bascially the way to outline how the CLI will run and flow. THis took me longer than expected. I watched many videos but i finally got the order and structure I wanted. This allowed me to better outline the CLI to get it working properly.

Next was the actual coding itself. Although I thought I knew what I was doing, I quickly learned that workign on your own and acually building was a whole new beast. I learned alot about coding, but also about patience, how to work, when to take breaks, and to keep emotions in check. I learned when to know to look for a new direction and even when to start a new if needed. Most importantly I learned that Google is your best friend and am not ashamed to go to it when in need.

Now the next step is to get back on track and continue learning. I have more motivation now and know I can succeed in programming. I know i can do this!
