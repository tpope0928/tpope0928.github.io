The time has come for my first independent project. I am very excited but nervous at the same time. I know I can do this! Although I had a few ideas for my first project, I was having trouble settling on one and choosing the one that is within reason, show my new abilities, appropriate for the requirements, but most importantly fun! I have chosen to create a CLI application to look up Breweries by state.

I thought the application would be very simple at first but the more I have been working on the the more complications grow. First the user is welcomed and is asked to put in the states abbreviation. The user would then be returned a list of all breweries in the state with information about website, address, associations, etc. Simple right? 

Wrong! People like beer. I like beer. No matter the state, more than 20 breweries would show up. A list of breweries with all the other information I want to include is enough to overwhelm the user. It overwhelmed me! So the easiest and best way around this is to number the breweries in the state. Next, if the user wants more information on a brewery, they will put in the number to the corresponding brewery to get additional information.

This beginning process has shown me how important planning, outlining, and pseudo code is. Thinking throughly about the goal I want to acheive and how to get there allowed me to find problems ahead of time and think about how to solve them. Now that the pregame is over, its time for the party to start! Writing out the actual code!
